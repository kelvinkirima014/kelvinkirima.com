I have't really been asked these questions frequently, but I would not mind answering if I were asked.

## At what age did you start to teach yourself how to program computers?
I started at 20, back in 2020. Yes, I'm 24 years now.

## How did you get into programming?
I wanted to make websites. Turns out, you need code, and so I had to teach myself how to write code.

## Do you like to Program?
I Love it. It's like my life finally had a meaning. Here was something I really liked that I wanted to be really good at. And it turns out, I can make a living out of it as well.

## What was your first Programming Language?
My first Hello World was in HTML, which is a markup language. My first 'real' programming language was Javascript.

## Why Javascript?
Because it's the scripting language for the web.

## What is your favorite programming language?
The Rust Programming Language.

## What your favorite thing about the Rust Programming Language?
The compiler guides you on how to program, it lets you know when you make a mistake, and helps you fix the mistake. It kinda teaches you how to program, and I know for sure that Rust has helped me become a better programmer.

## How many Programming languages do you know?
Let's see: Rust, Javascript, Typescript, Lua, Bash, Racket. Proficiency in that order.

## Are you looking to add any new languages to your stack? If so which one/s?
Yes, I'm currently learning myself some Erlang for great good, although I'm no where near good yet. I need to allocate some more time to it.

## Why Erlang?
Erlang is such a powerful language, especially when you want highly scalable and reliable software in a distributed environment. You see, Erlang uses something known as the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model), where each actor is a separate process in the Erlang virtual machine(also known as [BEAM](https://www.erlang.org/blog/a-brief-beam-primer/)). The processes are light-weight and isolated, i.e. if a process crashes, it never corrupts other processes' memory, ever.
Each Erlang virtual machine, or Erlang node can run millions of these processes and can communicate with each other via message passing, meaning we can send arbitrary code across nodes, which is kinda crazy.

## How do you learn a new language, or topic?
I just search for resources that teach the topic on the internet, mostly Reddit, and watch tutorials on Youtube. The key is to learn actively by copying the stuff you learn word by word, until you can write it from memory. Obviously you have to understand something in order to be able to create it, but the more you do it the easier it becomes. So, basically, practice.

## What resources are you using to learn Erlang?
I'm learning from a book called `Learn You some Erlang for Great Good`. It's freely available online [here](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/content).

## What Operating System are you running?
I'm running Fedora Linux, latest release.

## How's Fedora like?
Stable releases, fast startup, FOSS packages only, seamless upgrades, just works, awesome community. No complaints.

## What text-editor do you use?
Neovim, btw.

## How's your experience with Neovim been like?
The first text-editor I ever used was Sublime Text, then I switched to VsCode after a few months. The switch to Neovim wasn't an easy one, it took me a lot of time to first learn Vim motions and then to configure my environment. But I really wanted to make the switch and I'm glad I did. I can now navigate my workspaces much more efficiently, and I really enjoy writing the configs. I've written more about the experience in [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kelvin-kirima-25b010184_i-started-to-teach-myself-how-to-program-activity-7150909262901264384-240y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
