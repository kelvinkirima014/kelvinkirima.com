I have't really been asked these questions frequently, but I would not mind answering if I were.

## How did you get into programming?
I wanted to make websites. Turns out, you need code, and so I had to teach myself how to write code.

## Do you like to Program?
Yes, very much. Programming enriches my life with meaningfulness that I don't take for granted; I'm glad I found something I really like to do and that I want to be really good at.

## When did you start to program?
I started to teach myself how to code in late 2019. I was 19 years old then.

## What was your first Programming Language?
My first Hello World was in HTML, which is a markup language. My first 'real' programming language was Javascript.

## Why Javascript?
Because it's the scripting language for the web.

## Which programming languages do you mostly use?
Javascript, Typescript, Rust, Lua, Bash, Racket, C.

## Any favourite?
Yes, Rust.

## Why Rust?
I'm into backend systems and Rust is a joy to work with in this domain. Besides the speed of a low-level language and memory safety, Rust's rich type system and concepts like the Option and Result types make designing APIs a bliss by encouraging solid error handling through concepts built into the language itself.  

Rust enables all that without sacrificing expressiveness of the language, productivity, and developer experience. Modern language concepts like pattern matching and generics, the  Cargo package manager and solid development tools, all make working with Rust a breeze. Lest I forget, the compiler which not only catches my mistakes before runtime, but also acts like a kind teacher and guides me on how to fix them. 

## Are you looking to add any new languages to your stack? If so which one/s?
I like languages, not just the ones that tell a computer what to do. I can write, read and speak three natural languages fluently - English, Swahili and [Kimeru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meru_language). I've tried learning Chinese/Mandarin on Duolingo but I just know some basic stuff and my keyboards weren't really designed with Chinese in mind. I'll probably have to hire a tutor sometime in the future when things align. 

## What about programming languages?
I'm always experimenting with a new language every now and then. Currently, I'm learning myself some Erlang for great good, although I'm no where near good yet. I need to allocate some more time to it. I also want to add Go to my stack to make myself more hirable because it's incredibly popular in the industry.

## Why Erlang?
Erlang is such a powerful language, especially when you want highly scalable and reliable software in a distributed environment. You see, Erlang uses something known as the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model), where each actor is a separate process in the Erlang virtual machine(also known as [BEAM](https://www.erlang.org/blog/a-brief-beam-primer/)). The processes are light-weight and isolated, i.e. if a process crashes, it never corrupts other processes' memory, ever.
Each Erlang virtual machine, or Erlang node can run millions of these processes and can communicate with each other via message passing, meaning we can send arbitrary code across nodes, which is kinda crazy.

## How do you learn a new language, or topic?
I just search for resources(textbooks) that teach the topic on the internet, mostly Reddit, and watch tutorials on Youtube. The key is to learn actively by copying the stuff you learn word by word, until you can write it from memory. Obviously you have to understand something in order to be able to create it, but the more you do it the easier it becomes. So, basically, practice.

## What resources are you using to learn Erlang?
I'm learning from a book called `Learn You some Erlang for Great Good`. It's freely available online [here](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/content).

## What Operating System are you running?
I'm running Fedora Linux, latest release.

## How's Fedora like?
Stable releases, fast startup, FOSS packages only, seamless upgrades, just works, awesome community. No complaints.

## What text-editor do you use?
Neovim, btw.

## How's your experience with Neovim been like?
The first text-editor I ever used was Sublime Text, then I switched to VsCode after a few months. The switch to Neovim wasn't an easy one, it took me a lot of time to first learn Vim motions and then to configure my environment. But I really wanted to make the switch and I'm glad I did. I can now navigate my workspaces much more efficiently, and I really enjoy writing the configs. I've written more about the experience in [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kelvin-kirima-25b010184_i-started-to-teach-myself-how-to-program-activity-7150909262901264384-240y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).   

## Besides Programming, what else do you enjoy?
I enjoy taking long nature walks; the good thing is I live close to a forest and so I take long strolls every time I get a chance.

## Where do you live?
Besides the internet? A small highland county known as Meru, Kenya.

## How's it like over there?
It's very beautiful. We're lucky that a small stream passes through our shamba, and we are also just a few meters away from the Mt.Kenya forest.

## What do most people do for a living? 
Most guys here are farmers; my parents too. We grow tea on our farm that's sold to a factory and exported; we also keep cattle and poultry for milk and the eggs. 

## Have you always lived there?
I was born and grew up here, but I went to Nairobi for college and lived there for a while before coming back home last year.

## What's Nairobi like?
There's a lot I love and miss about Nairobi; there's a vibrant street food culture which I enjoy, the Matatus are a whole freaking vibe, the streets are lively, and the girls beautiful. To quote the great author Karen Blixen, aka, Isak Dinesen of Out of Africa: 
> There's no world without Nairobi's streets.

## Are there other places in the world you would like to visit?
Yes. I hope to visit every Afrikan country before I die. Besides Afrika, another travel destination I dream of is Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.

## Why Ensenada?
It's a place that's been on mind since the first time I listened to a song I really like: *The Road to Ensenada*, by Lylle Lovett.

## What's your favorite song?
My favourite song is *A Commet Appears*, by The Shins, what a lovely, lovely song.
