Hello, I'm Kirima and welcome to my place on the internet. 

## About Me

I'm a computer programmer, independent author and educator with deep insights on programming languages, computer networks, and media technologies.

My primary focus is on web communication protocols and all areas of audio/video streaming. I'm currently hacking on [Majiix](https://github.com/Majgix/Majiix), an opensource low-latency platform for web-based teleconferencing.  

Before Majiix, I worked with a technical education agency to help train and onboard developers to the Rust Programming Language. If interested on learning more about me, please check out the [faq](/faq).
