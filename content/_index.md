Hello, I'm Kirima and welcome to my place on the internet. 

## Background

I'm a computer programmer, educator, and independent author with experience in web technologies, computer networks and communication protocols.

I consider myself a focused individual who can get things done. I write code(mostly backend), but I'm also interested in all areas of audio/video streaming. I'm currently hacking on [Majiix](https://github.com/Majgix/Majiix), an opensource low-latency platform for web-based teleconferencing.  

Before Majiix, I worked with a technical education agency to help train and onboard developers to the Rust Programming Language. If interested on learning more about me, please check out the [faq](/faq).
