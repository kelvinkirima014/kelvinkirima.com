Hello, I'm Kirima and welcome to my place on the internet. 

## Background

I'm a computer programmer with experience in web technologies, computer networks and communication protocols.

I write code(mostly backend), but I'm also interested in all areas of audio/video streaming. I work remotely for a UK based company from my rented place in Nairobi. In my free time, I hack on [Majiix](https://github.com/Majgix/Majiix), an opensource low-latency platform for web-based teleconferencing.  

If interested on learning more about me, please check out the [faq](/faq).
