Hello, I'm Kirima and welcome to my little corner on the internet. 

## About Me

I'm a computer programmer, independent author and educator with deep insights on programming languages, computer networks and web communication protocols.

My primary focus is building backend APIs and features powering web applications using cutting-edge technologies. I'm currently building [Majiix](https://github.com/Majgix/Majiix), an opensource low-latency platform for real-time collaboration on the web. We are still in early stages, but I'm super hopeful for it.  

Before Majiix, I worked with a technical education agency to help train and onboard developers to the Rust Programming Language. If interested on learning more about me, please check out the [faq](/faq).
