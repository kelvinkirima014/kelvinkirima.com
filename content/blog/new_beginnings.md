This is the first post on my new blog. I've wanted to get back to publishing new articles for a long time, but I always kept procrastinating.

I don't know why I pushed this away for so long. I enjoy writing, and blogs are my favorite form of content, I even prefer them to videos. I published my [first technical article](https://dev.to/kelvinkirima014/how-memory-is-allocated-in-javascript-1l65) back in 2020, and people still derive value from the content I published back then. Looking back, I can see how much interest and curiosity I had to learn new things and explore them. Curiosity fuels motivation, and motivation fuels hard work, and I believe that what has kept me going and pushed me to be better at my craft over the few years I've been doing this. 

Now that I've pushed my lazy ass to build this site, I intend to write more, and share my learnings, interests, and explorations with you. My main goal right now is to get better at my craft by doing more work, building more projects and solving interesting problems. I'm optimistic about this next phase of my life, and I can't wait to share it with you, my friends.
